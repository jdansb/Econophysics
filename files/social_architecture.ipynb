Given this fact, we have only three options: 1) accept it, 2) try to mitigate it through reforms (e.g., wealth taxes), 3) replace it with a new mode of production."

        "\n",
        "Since I am not interested in producing a very long text, I will take the opportunity to use the summary created automatically by [alphaXiv](https://www.alphaxiv.org/overview/2410.22369v2):\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "- Many agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to generate realistic wealth distributions, often resulting in wealth condensation or requiring external interventions like taxes to avoid it.\n",
        "- Existing ABMs frequently rely on exogenously imposed mechanisms (e.g., tax structures, savings propensities) to produce observed economic patterns, making their results dependent on these assumptions.\n",
        "- While Ian Wright's Social Architecture (SA) model naturally reproduces realistic dual-regime wealth distributions and class structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Results\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Social Architecture model naturally self-organizes into a distinct two-class society (workers, capitalists) and robustly reproduces dual-regime wealth and income distributions (exponential and power-law) without external interventions.\n",
        "- The dynamics of inequality within the model are primarily governed by a single dimensionless ratio, R = /p (wealth per capita divided by the average wage).\n",
        "- An increase in wealth per capita (analogous to economic growth), while average wages remain fixed, inherently leads to an increase in economic inequality by amplifying wealth concentration among capitalists, challenging the assumption that economic growth benefits all classes equally.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Critical Policy Implications\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper's most significant contribution lies in its counter-intuitive finding about economic growth and inequality. The analysis demonstrates that \"in an economy where total wealth is conserved and with a fixed average wage, the increase in wealth per capita comes with more inequality.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This challenges conventional wisdom suggesting that overall economic growth (analogous to increasing $\\bar{w}$) inherently benefits all social classes. Instead, the model shows that growth without corresponding wage increases tends to amplify wealth concentration among capitalists while diminishing workers' relative economic position.\n",
        "\n",
        "This finding has profound implications for policy discussions, suggesting that aggregate economic indicators like GDP may be misleading without considering distributional effects. The research supports theoretical arguments that unregulated capitalism has inherent tendencies toward increasing inequality, requiring active policy intervention to achieve more equitable outcomes."

        "\n",
        "The model implemented in this paper is the original SA proposed by Ian Wright. However, we have chosen a slightly different notation and terminology to align with those commonly used in econophysics and agent-based modeling.\n",
        "The society consists of $N$ agents (labeled $i=1,\\dots,N$), where each agent $i$ has a positive integer quantity $w_i(t)$ representing money which varies over time. An agent is not necessarily an individual, but can represent other economic entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The population size $N$ and the total wealth of the system $W= \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i(t)$ are conserved, so the wealth per capita $\\overline{w}=W/N$ is constant.\n",
        "Agents can be in one of three classes: employees (working class), employers (capitalist class), or unemployed.\n",
        "Then, each agent is characterized by an index $e_i\\neq i$, which identifies their employer: $e_i = j$ if agent $j$ is the employer of agent $i$, and $e_i = 0$ if agent $i$ is unemployed or employer.\n",
        "Therefore, at any time $t$,  the state of the entire economy is defined by the set of pairs $S(t) = \\left\\{ \\left( w_i(t), e_i(t) \\right) :1\\leq i\\leq N \\right\\}$. A firm  consists of a set of employees and an employer, which is the only owner of the firm.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the system size $N$ and the wealth per capita $\\overline{w}$, there are two other parameters:\n",
        "the minimum and maximum wages, $p_a$ and $p_b$, that each employee can receive. These four are the only parameters of the model.\n",
        "Random selections (of agents, wealth aliquots, wages, etc.) are made uniformly, unless otherwise specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the initial state, all agents have the same wealth ($w_i(0)={W}/N$) and are all unemployed ($e_i(0)=0$).\n",
        "At each time step (which we set to be a month as in the original paper), the following six steps are executed $N$ times, to give each agent the opportunity to be active once per month on average.\n",

        "1. **Agent selection**:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- A random integer $w$ in the range $\\left[0,w_{k}\\right]$ is selected for a random agent $k\\neq i$.\n",

        "\n",
        "- The number $m$ of employees to be fired is defined according to the  formula\n",
        "$ m=max(n_{i}-\\frac{w_{i}}{\\overline{p}},0)$,  where $n_i$ is the number of employees of agent $i$.\n",
