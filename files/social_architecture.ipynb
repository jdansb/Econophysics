        "\n",
        "Since I am not interested in producing a very long text, I will take the opportunity to use the summary created automatically by [alphaXiv](https://www.alphaxiv.org/overview/2410.22369v2):\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "- Many agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to generate realistic wealth distributions, often resulting in wealth condensation or requiring external interventions like taxes to avoid it.\n",
        "- Existing ABMs frequently rely on exogenously imposed mechanisms (e.g., tax structures, savings propensities) to produce observed economic patterns, making their results dependent on these assumptions.\n",
        "- While Ian Wright's Social Architecture (SA) model naturally reproduces realistic dual-regime wealth distributions and class structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Results\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Social Architecture model naturally self-organizes into a distinct two-class society (workers, capitalists) and robustly reproduces dual-regime wealth and income distributions (exponential and power-law) without external interventions.\n",
        "- The dynamics of inequality within the model are primarily governed by a single dimensionless ratio, R = /p (wealth per capita divided by the average wage).\n",
        "- An increase in wealth per capita (analogous to economic growth), while average wages remain fixed, inherently leads to an increase in economic inequality by amplifying wealth concentration among capitalists, challenging the assumption that economic growth benefits all classes equally.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Critical Policy Implications\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper's most significant contribution lies in its counter-intuitive finding about economic growth and inequality. The analysis demonstrates that \"in an economy where total wealth is conserved and with a fixed average wage, the increase in wealth per capita comes with more inequality.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This challenges conventional wisdom suggesting that overall economic growth (analogous to increasing $\\bar{w}$) inherently benefits all social classes. Instead, the model shows that growth without corresponding wage increases tends to amplify wealth concentration among capitalists while diminishing workers' relative economic position.\n",
        "\n",
        "This finding has profound implications for policy discussions, suggesting that aggregate economic indicators like GDP may be misleading without considering distributional effects. The research supports theoretical arguments that unregulated capitalism has inherent tendencies toward increasing inequality, requiring active policy intervention to achieve more equitable outcomes."

        "The society consists of $N$ agents (labeled $i=1,\\dots,N$), where each agent $i$ has a positive integer quantity $w_i(t)$ representing money which varies over time. An agent is not necessarily an individual, but can represent other economic entities.\n",

        "Then, each agent is characterized by an index $e_i\\neq i$, which identifies their employer: $e_i = j$ if agent $j$ is the employer of agent $i$, and $e_i = 0$ if agent $i$ is unemployed or employer.\n",
        "Therefore, at any time $t$,  the state of the entire economy is defined by the set of pairs $S(t) = \\left\\{ \\left( w_i(t), e_i(t) \\right) :1\\leq i\\leq N \\right\\}$. A firm  consists of a set of employees and an employer, which is the only owner of the firm.\n",

In the book, it is also referred to as the “probabilistic model of the social relations of capitalism.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The dominant social relations of production in capitalism are between capitalists and workers. A small class of capitalists employs a large number of workers organized in firms of various sizes to produce goods and services to be sold on the market. Under normal circumstances, the capitalist collects the revenue, and the workers receive a portion of it in the form of wages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the past century or more, the number and type of goods and services offered by capitalist economies have changed, but the social relations of production have not. The existence of social relations between the capitalist class and the working class, mediated by wages and profits, is an invariant feature of capitalism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many economic models describe utility relations among economic agents and the type of scarce commodities, or theorize about the material-technical dependencies between inputs and outputs in the production process. But what we want to examine are the social relations of dependency mediated by money. As such, the model is constructed solely from money and agents. The idea is to focus as much as possible on the economic consequences of the social relations of production—that is, on the social architecture—rather than any particular or even transient mechanism, such as a specific market or commodity. Since the worker-capitalist relation is the dominant social relation in capitalism, the model abstracts away from land, the state, banks, and other factors.\n",

Although we use a small and simple set of hypotheses about relations in capitalism, when we simulate it, we can observe that it replicates some of the most important characteristics of modern capitalism. The computer thus serves as a logical testing ground, and the simulation allows us to explore the complex consequences of our simple assumptions. It lets us determine whether important large-scale features of a capitalist economy necessarily arise from its most basic social relations.\n"

After all, if the value added by the worker is less than the salary paid, the firm would incur a loss; it would be more advantageous to sell the product without any added value. A firm's profit margin over costs reflects this expectation, which may or may not be validated by the market. Naturally, various factors can cause a worker to add more or less value to the final product, which is difficult to measure and partially reflected in the wide range of negotiable compensation.\n",

Samples per employee reflect the fact that each worker potentially adds value, but the randomness of each sample reflects the variety of possibilities, from irreplaceable movie stars to easily replaceable administrators. This is a weak formulation of the labor theory of value, which implies that, in the absence of a profit-equalizing mechanism, there is a statistical tendency for a firm's product value to be linearly related to the amount of socially necessary labor time spent on it, and consequently, the greater the number of employees in a firm, the higher its profit.\n",

In an idealized competitive economy, there is a tendency for productions with particular advantages to be adopted by competing firms, including the elimination of scarcity due to the use of specialized labor in particular tasks. We can then assume that the value added per worker is statistically uniform across firms.

Of course, this does not guarantee that all actors will necessarily act in the month; some may act more than once, while others may not act at all. This introduces a level of intentional randomness to model the fact that in real economies, events do not occur with strict regularity. Logically, a year is defined as 12 applications of the monthly rule. The model thus provides a time scale linked to real time by the fact that, on average, wages are paid monthly.\n",

In reality, the social relations of production are much more complex than those presented in this model, but it is evident that the capitalist class is numerically small compared to the working class. In other words, those who rely on wages for subsistence constitute the large majority of the population; this model also successfully captures this fact.\n"

However, it can be said that the empirical coverage of the model is extensive, even though the model was defined from small and simple economic rules governing the dynamics. The model compresses and connects a large amount of empirical data within a single framework. The idea was to show how the peculiar social relations of capitalism have a pervasive effect and determine many of the properties of capitalism at a macro level. We can extend this modeling in many ways and explore many aspects that can be measured and analyzed; this is just a starting point.\n",

        "The basic elements of this model therefore differ from standard economic models. For example, standard competitive or neoclassical equilibrium models typically start from an ontology of rational agents who maximize self-interest in a scarce resource market: the focus is on determining the equilibrium exchange rate of commodities, which is a solution to a set of static constants. Typically, money is not modeled, and time is absent.\n",

        "Neo-Ricardian models, on the other hand, start from the ontology of production technique relations between different types of commodities, which define the material transformation available for agents to perform. The production of commodities results in a surplus that is distributed between capitalists and workers. Despite differences between the models, there are similarities. Prices in these models are also exchange rates determined by solutions conditioned on constants, and time is also absent. There is also no explanation of why or how a particular configuration of the economy produces effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a difference between these models and the one developed here. The most obvious is that we have neither types of commodities nor rational agents. Instead, we model the elements of the economy that are ignored in these other models, specifically the agent-to-agent relationships mediated by money that occur over time. At an abstract level, neoclassical models theorize scarcity constraints and neo-Ricardian models production-technical constraints; this model theorizes the dynamic consequences of social constraints, which are historical facts about how economic production is socially organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are deep sociological reasons why standard economic theory is resistant to criticism and has remained largely unchanged. Furthermore, the model we describe here provides proof that the standard ontology is redundant for forming explanations of the phenomena it aims to explore.\n",

        "It does not deny that other issues may require considering the purposefulness of activity for explanation, and thus the introduction of rational agents or consideration of production-technical constraints, and then the introduction of types of commodities. What the model described here claims is that, for the empirical aggregates considered, there is no need to reduce political economy to psychology and technical production conditions, and that the dominant causal factors are not found at the individual behavior level, nor at the level of production-technical constraints, but are found at the social level of production relations, which constitute an abstract, yet no less real, social architecture that constrains the actions individuals can take, whether optimized or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is why agents choose among possible economic options restricted by their class and the money they possess. This is an approximation to the classical political economy conception of Smith, Ricardo, and Marx, in which individuals are considered representatives of economic classes that have defined relations with each other in the production process. The social architecture—particularly the social relation of wage-capital—dominates individuals, who in turn are free to make local economic decisions, but within a social environment that is not under their control.\n",
        "\n",
        "The method of abstraction of rationality adopted here, rather than emphasizing the particular nature of individuals, is valid because the number of degrees of freedom that the economic reality presents is very large. This allows the rationality of individuals to be modeled with a highly stochastic selection from a set of possibilities defined according to the social architecture.\n",

The motivation for this approach is based on Marx’s distinction between invariant social relations of production and the variable forces of production. Capitalism changes over time, but the existence of the social roles of worker and capitalist is unaltered and an intrinsic characteristic of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The production model replicated some important empirical features of modern capitalism:\n",
        "- The tendency of capital concentration resulting in a highly unequal distribution characterized by a lognormal distribution with a “Pareto tail”  \n",
        "- The Zipf or power-law distribution of firm sizes  \n",
        "- The Laplace distribution of firm sizes and GDP growth  \n",

        "- The lognormal distribution of firm exits  \n",
        "- The Gamma-type distribution of profit rates\n",

        "\n",
        "The good qualitative—and in many cases quantitative—agreement between the model and empirical phenomena suggests that the theory presented here captures some essential characteristics of the capitalist economy, and demonstrates the importance of social relations of production, as well as serving as a foundation for more concrete and elaborated models.\n",
        "\n",
        "A final conclusion we can draw is that the implication that certain features of the economy that cause political conflicts, such as income inequality and recessions, are necessary consequences of the social relations of production, and therefore essential properties of capitalism, not merely accidental, transient, or exogenous events.\n"
