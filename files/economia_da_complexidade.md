I have already made some comments on the [philosophy of econophysics](https://github.com/jdansb/Econophysics/blob/main/files/Filosofia%20da%20Econof%C3%ADsica.md) and some comments on [monetary economics from an econophysics perspective](https://github.com/jdansb/Econophysics/blob/main/files/monetary.ipynb). Now I want to provide some commentary from an economist on econophysics, based on the work [Economia da Complexidade](https://fernandonogueiracosta.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fernando-nogueira-da-costa-economia-da-complexidade-ou-econofisica-ago-2024.pdf). To be honest, much of what is written here consists mainly of excerpts taken from the book itself, translated and reorganized in order to present what I understand to be the central idea of the entire material in a coherent way.



## Introduction
Econophysics is a field of study aimed at relating or explaining economic phenomena with the aid of techniques from Physics. The techniques typically used for this purpose involve nonlinear dynamics, stochastic processes, and uncertainties. Within Probability Theory, a stochastic process is a family of random variables representing the evolution of a system of values over time. It is the probabilistic counterpart of a deterministic process.

Instead of a process with a single path of evolution, a stochastic process has inherent indeterminacy. With small variations, there are multiple—sometimes infinitely many—directions in which the process can evolve away from a given condition. When the natural system under study is nature itself, and encoding and decoding are performed using Mathematics, it is common to say that what is being done is Physics.

A relevant point for understanding what a physicist does is to compare them with an economist. In orthodox economics, the “rule” is atomistic reductionism, in which reality must be explained in terms of a representative rational agent. Orthodox economists assume that the aggregate behavior of a system is identical to the sum of the effects of each individual cause.

In turn, the physicist uses, as a “principle,” interactive reductionism; that is, they do not attempt to describe a system’s agent in isolation, but rather aim to describe the interactions of an agent with others. For a physicist, the interaction between agents results in a statistical description of the system’s aggregate behavior.

Economists labeled as heterodox engage in Econophysics when they incorporate the idea that the economy’s resulting performance emerges from the interactions among its diverse components: the psychologies of economic agents, institutions, adaptations, innovations, disruptions, and so on. They seek a transdisciplinary perspective.

The theoretical avant-garde of economists aims to develop a Social Physics in order to expand socioeconomic and political thinking, including not only competitive forces but also exchanges of ideas, information, and pressures for social status, in order to better explain collective human behavior. It seeks to explain how social interactions generate the dynamic self-organization of the economy as a complex system—that is, to understand how from the social interactions of system components, from individual agents to the community, the market, and the state, a networked society emerges.

## Making Sense of Chaos

J. Doyne Farmer is an American entrepreneur, complex systems scientist, and author of the book *Making Sense of Chaos: A Better Economics*. Although it took him ten years to write, in it the physicist partially presents his current research in economics, including Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), financial instability, and technological progress.

The economic impact of the COVID pandemic combined three exceptional characteristics that made standard models inadequate:  
1. The shocks were sector-specific, making it essential to model the economy with high resolution;  
2. The shocks simultaneously affected both supply and demand;  
3. The shocks were very strong and occurred very rapidly.

Conventional economic models passively wait for a return to equilibrium—that is, for supply and demand to become equal. It was therefore necessary to quickly build a heterodox model capable of tracking the dynamics of the shocks without assuming the existence of equilibrium. Complexity economists provided a model that achieved what is called *verisimilitude*: it made the most important mechanisms capable of affecting the economy realistic enough to deliver accurate forecasts. This served as a proof of concept for the usefulness of Complexity Economics—the central theme of Farmer’s book.

Complexity Economics is a transdisciplinary movement of rebellious economists and other scientists against orthodoxy. It seeks to better understand the economy by using principles entirely different from those of standard economics. The COVID model was the first to use methods of complex economics to make an accurate prediction of a major economic event, outperforming traditional models.

The core assumptions of mainstream economics do not correspond to reality, and methods based on them do not scale well from small to large problems. Moreover, they fail to take full advantage of huge advances in data and technology. The incorrect answers of standard economic theory end up justifying inaction—namely, the outdated laissez-faire approach of the free market.


## Philosophical Difference

The diagnosis made by the physicist turned quasi-economist, J. Doyne Farmer, is that the problems faced by orthodox economics are inherent to the conceptual structure dominant within the profession. This conceptual framework, he argues, “is not suitable for dealing with large, messy, complicated, real-world problems.”

Idealist Philosophy and Materialist Philosophy are two major philosophical traditions in the Western world. They differ radically in their approaches to the nature of reality, the origin of knowledge, and the relationship between mind and matter.

Idealist Philosophy emphasizes the primacy of ideas, mind, or consciousness as the foundation of reality. For idealists, reality is ultimately mental or spiritual—not physical. According to this view, material existence depends on mental perception: objects exist only when they are perceived by a mind. Material entities are manifestations or representations of an underlying spiritual reality. Knowledge, in turn, is obtained independently of sensory experience, through reason or introspection. Certain categories of understanding are considered innate and serve to structure our experience of the world.

In contrast, Materialist Philosophy emphasizes the primacy of matter as the foundation of all reality. For materialists, consciousness and ideas are products of material processes. Matter is the fundamental substance of the universe, and all phenomena—including consciousness—arise from material interactions. Thought and consciousness are the results of the brain’s material activity. Ultimate reality is physical and can be understood through the study of material properties and interactions.

For example, Karl Marx’s view was that the economic infrastructure (relations of production and productive forces) determines the social superstructure (political, cultural, and ideological institutions). In this line of thought, materialist scientists, such Doyne Farmer, base their understanding of the universe on experimentation and empirical evidence. Reality exists independently of human perception.

Because of this epistemological divide, idealist economists place emphasis on ideas, moral and spiritual values, introspection—and on neoliberal ideology itself! In contrast, materialists emphasize economic analysis, empirical science, and the material transformation of social conditions.

This opposition is reflected in philosophical, scientific, and social thought, shaping debates about the nature of being, knowledge, and society. In the case of J. Doyne Farmer, by “theory,” he means building models of the world based on assumptions about how it actually works.


## Agent-Based Modeling

There is a standard model for constructing economic theories that incorporates the agents’ reasoning capacity. This model, linked to standard economic theory, assigns each agent a utility function describing their preferences—and how to maximize their own utility or happiness. Equations express this mathematically.

Complexity Economics offers a completely different alternative by using ideas and methods from the science of complex systems, a transdisciplinary movement that studies emergent phenomena in complex systems. Emergent phenomena occur when the behavior of a system as a whole is qualitatively different from that of its individual or interactive components.

Complexity Economics assumes that agents are boundedly rational—that is, they make imperfect decisions and have limited reasoning capacity. Agents can learn to pursue goals, but they usually achieve them only partially. Their decisions are decentralized and uncoordinated.

According to J. Doyne Farmer, although it also uses equations, computational simulation is the flagship of Complexity Economics. Digital technology allows it to create real-world analogs with computer support. Scientists are using computer simulations to study almost everything that can be interpreted as a complex system. Traditional economists use computers to solve equations—but that is not simulation in the modern sense.

The simulations used in Complexity Economics are called Agent-Based Models (ABMs). An Agent-Based Model is a computational simulation approach used to study complex systems composed of multiple interacting agents. This model is useful across various disciplines—including Economics, Sociology, Ecology, and Computer Science—to understand how local interactions among individual agents can lead to emergent patterns at the macro level.

An ABM is a class of computational models in which the behavior of a system is simulated through the interactions of autonomous and individual agents. These agents represent people, firms, or any entity capable of making decisions based on simple rules.

- *Agents*: These are individual entities with specific behaviors and decision-making capabilities. Each agent operates according to a set of rules or algorithms that define its actions. They have attributes such as memory, learning ability, goals, and decision-making strategies.  
- *Environment*: This is the space where agents interact. It can be physical, such as a national territory, or abstract, such as a network of social interactions. It has its own rules and dynamics—such as spatial constraints or available resources—that affect the agents.  
- *Interactions*: These occur among agents and between agents and the environment, and are fundamental to ABMs. Economic exchanges, cooperation, competition, communication, and migration are examples of possible interactions.  
- *Behavioral rules*: These determine how agents make decisions based on their internal state and the state of the environment, thereby shaping how interactions occur. They may include optimization algorithms, simple heuristics, machine learning, or logic-based models.  
- *Computational simulation*: This involves running the model over time, allowing agents’ interactions and behaviors to evolve. Time can be represented in a discrete or continuous manner. The evolution of the system is observed through changes in the state of the agents and the environment.  

In the context of ABMs, *agency* refers to the ability of agents to make autonomous decisions and act based on those decisions. Agency is crucial because it allows each agent to contribute to the system’s overall emergent behavior. Agents can act according to their own rules and objectives without the need for centralized coordination. They usually differ from one another in terms of attributes, behaviors, and goals, reflecting the diversity found in real systems, where heterogeneity predominates.

Although decisions are made locally by each agent, their collective interactions lead to global emergent patterns that are not easily predictable from individual behavior. Examples of ABM applications are multiplying across disciplines — in economics, sociology (e.g., information diffusion), ecology (e.g., population dynamics), and more. Therefore, ABMs are valuable tools for understanding complex systems, where emergent behavior results from the interactions of many autonomous agents.

There are many advantages to using simulations instead of solving mathematical equations. They make it possible to model the diversity of real-world participants — what these economists call *heterogeneity*. Standard economic theory assumes that transactions occur only when supply equals demand, a state known as equilibrium. In contrast, complex economy models consider equilibrium, when it does occur, as an *emergent property*.

Taken together, all these elements lead to a very different way of dealing with change. Change arises not only “from the outside” but also “from within,” when market forces act upon themselves. Standard economics has difficulty dealing with transformations that originate within the free market. Conventional financial crisis models tended to assume only *exogenous shocks* as causes.

Standard economic theory produces tractable models in simple environments, but this approach fails when things get complicated — the equations become too difficult to solve, and adding new features to an existing model becomes increasingly hard. As a result, when a problem grows complex, traditional economists are forced to oversimplify, leaving the “spurious” — the messy, realistic part — out. Building realistic models requires good data. ABMs are naturally well-suited to exploit the vast amounts of data now available on the trillions of transactions recorded annually.

This modeling approach studies the economy from the bottom up: macroeconomics emerges from microeconomics. Milton Friedman once argued that models should be judged solely by their predictive power, rather than by the plausibility of their assumptions. Even if those assumptions were unrealistic, economists should use them “as if” they were true.

Farmer warns that we should be deeply suspicious of models that rely on implausible “as if” assumptions. Instead, we should follow what he calls the *principle of verisimilitude*: models should fit the facts, and their assumptions should be plausible. Unrealistic assumptions are more likely to lead to false conclusions than plausible ones.

The principle of verisimilitude recognizes that models must include the key characteristics of the phenomena they aim to explain, but they don’t need to be literal representations of the world. By definition, models are abstractions; they don’t have to capture every detail. Verisimilitude simply means capturing the essential components as realistically as possible. Good models should be as simple as possible — but not too simple.

Agent-Based Models (ABMs) can be simple or complex, depending on necessity. After all, computers can easily handle details that are mathematically difficult to formulate, allowing us to include as many features as we need. Moreover, it is possible to add new features without altering existing ones, gradually increasing the realism of the world model. The transdisciplinary approach, whose ideas have significantly influenced this field, has shown that the use of practical decision-making rules is often more effective, in many contexts, than traditional optimization models.

While complexity economists remain at the margins of academic economics, their models are beginning to gain support from institutions dissatisfied with conventional tools. This includes some avant-garde Central Banks that use such models to monitor financial markets and prevent new collapses. The new science of Complexity Economics represents a radical shift in the way economics is taught. The fact that its intellectual structure is so different implies a complete reformulation of its tools, skill base, and body of knowledge — that is, a profound cultural transformation. Such a significant change is strongly resisted by the mainstream, as revolutions always are.

### Capacidade de predição

Os economistas ortodoxos geralmente simplesmente presumem os preços estarem em equilíbrio, definido como o ponto onde a oferta é igual à demanda. Porém, na verdade, na maioria dos mercados, as transações são feitas a preços onde a oferta não é igual à procura. Uma das contribuições da Economia da Complexidade é compreender como os preços se movem quando os mercados
operam fora de equilíbrio. Vê a economia como um sistema complexo em evolução.

Farmer desejava se afastar da abordagem reducionista. Quando estava na pós-graduação, descobriu a Cibernética, a precursora da teoria dos sistemas complexos.  Embora a maioria dos economistas tenha alguns consensos, eles adotam uma série de modelos diferentes e fazem previsões divergentes. Seus leitores ou ouvintes ficam livres para escolher o modelo mais benéfico, para si, baseado em ideologia, política ou interesse próprio.

O objetivo no citado livro é apresentar uma visão de como podemos construir modelos capazes de fazer as melhores previsões econômicas. Surpreendentemente, muitos economistas não concordam com a importância deste objetivo, pois a precisão preditiva raramente é enfatizada na pesquisa econômica. Nesse sentido, difere da pesquisa na Física.

Farmer argumenta: modelos com previsões fracas são limitados na sua capacidade de promover a compreensão econômica do mundo. Pergunta: se não pudermos fazer previsões confiáveis, então como sabemos se a estrutura conceitual, para pensar sobre o mundo e avaliar as escolhas políticas, está correta?

Nunca seremos capazes de prever a economia com perfeição – longe disso – mas podemos fazer muito melhor diante do que foi feito até agora. Sim, predição é difícil, mas há muitos exemplos de boas previsões, até mesmo do futuro.


Mudanças na economia se enquadram em duas categorias básicas: vindas de fora do sistema econômico ou geradas dentro.
- Explicação padrão: A explicação oferecida pelos modelos econômicos padrão laissez-faire é as mudanças na economia sempre serem iniciadas por influências externas, chamadas de choques exógenos: eventos aleatórios provenientes de fora da economia e, por definição, imprevisíveis.
- Explicação alternativa: A explicação alternativa ou heterodoxa é a mudança vir de dentro, ou, em jargão técnico, o movimento é endógeno: a economia muda por conta própria devido a fatores internos. Na realidade, é uma mistura dos dois – às vezes a economia responde a choques externos, às vezes as mudanças surgem de dentro, e às vezes ambos os tipos de causas atuam ao mesmo tempo.

Os modelos capazes de descreverem como as coisas mudam ao longo do tempo são conhecidos como sistemas dinâmicos. A maioria dos sistemas dinâmicos tem o chamado de atrator. Este atrator determina seu comportamento em longo prazo, isto é, para qual estado o sistema tende a evoluir e entrar em equilíbrio. Porém há um atrator com uma natureza muito diferente aos quais os físicos estavam acostumados e foi apropriadamente chamado de atrator caótico. O movimento que ele produz passou a ser
chamado caos.

O caos é caracterizado por duas propriedades essenciais: primeira, a dependência sensível das condições iniciais; a segunda é o movimento endógeno, ou seja, mesmo caso não haja choques externos, opara praticamente qualquer condição inicial que não seja um ponto de equilíbrio instável, o sistema exibirá um movimento contínuo e aperiódico.

Daí Farmer lança a questão-chave: a economia é caótica? A Ciência Econômica tradicional não enfrenta o caos. Um problema com os modelos macroeconômicos prevalecentes é eles terem apenas atratores de ponto fixo. Então, se o mercado for deixado em paz, ele entrará em um estado de repouso e permanecerá lá para sempre. Isto implica, para os economistas ortodoxos, todas as crises de mudanças na economia só serem impulsionadas por eventos externos, jamais pelo livre mercado.

Para explicar por qual razão a economia de mercado muda, os economistas têm de postular a existência de choques capazes de afastar o modelo de o equilíbrio. Eles não preveem os choques, só como a economia relaxará de volta ao equilíbrio. Para a economia da complexidadde, se a economia produz movimento endógeno sem ser um simples ciclo limite ou uma combinação de ciclos limites, a hipótese é ser devido ao caos. Em modelos de economia complexa, o caos é comum. Explica como a aleatoriedade emerge da ordem, mas é apenas um pequeno subcampo dentro de sistemas complexos.
