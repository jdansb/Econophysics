Economy (and politics) is quite a controversial subject, one that inflames both mind and heart. Since I am entering this field without any formal study in either economics or politics, my first idea was to adopt a relatively neutral position. But real neutrality is impossible, and the effort to try to please everyone can be counterproductive, culminating in a sterile work that pleases no one.  

There are at least two distinct approaches to studying economics. These differ from the most basic assumptions about the very object of study of this science, so that—whether we are aware of it or not—we end up adopting a stance that turns out to be incompatible with another. It is not a great secret that econophysics has traditionally been critical of the marginalist approach to economics. A discussion of this can be found in the text by the Brazilian economist recommended on the home page: *Economia da complexidade: Econofísica* (Fernando Nogueira da Costa).  

So the question remains: what about the other approach? If the marginalist theory of value by utility does not seem naturally compatible with econophysics, what is the situation of the labor theory of value from the Marxist approach? Well, it is precisely this approach that I believe to be naturally more compatible with econophysics and with the description of real systems. But I do not want to discuss economics itself—I leave that to the specialists.  

What I can do is recommend a book: *Curso de introdução à economia política* (Paul Singer). Marxist economics is part of a broader theoretical framework—Marxism itself—and it is this framework that I would like to briefly comment on. If I am openly defining myself as a Marxist, what do I mean by this? What do I understand it to mean to be a Marxist? Or, even better: what is Marxism? This is what I want to comment on.    

For those interested in learning more about Marxism, I have three main recommendations:  
- [The Worldview and Philosophical Methodology of Marxism-Leninism (Traduzido por Luna Nguyen)](https://foreignlanguages.press/product/basic-principles-of-marxism-leninism-a-primer-jose-maria-sison/)
- [Basic Principles of Marxism-Leninism: A Primer (Jose Maria Sison)](https://foreignlanguages.press/product/basic-principles-of-marxism-leninism-a-primer-jose-maria-sison/)
- [Anti-Dühring (Friedrich Engels)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/)[^1]
