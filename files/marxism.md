# Marxism

Economy (and politics) is quite a controversial subject, one that inflames both mind and heart. Since I am entering this field without any formal study in either economics or politics, my first idea was to adopt a relatively neutral position; however, real neutrality is impossible, and the effort to please everyone can be counterproductive, culminating in a sterile work that pleases no one.  

There are at least two distinct approaches to studying economics. These differ in the most basic assumptions about the very object of study of this science, so that—whether we are aware of it or not—we end up adopting a stance that turns out to be incompatible with another. It is not a great secret that econophysics has traditionally been critical of the marginalist approach to economics. A discussion of this can be found in the text by the Brazilian economist recommended on the home page: *Economia da complexidade: Econofísica* (Fernando Nogueira da Costa).  

So the question remains: what about the other approach? If the marginalist theory of value by utility does not seem naturally compatible with econophysics, what is the situation of the labor theory of value from the Marxist approach? Well, it is precisely this approach that I believe is naturally more compatible with econophysics and with the description of real systems. But I do not want to discuss economics itself—I leave that to the specialists.  

What I can do is recommend a book: *Curso de introdução à economia política* (Paul Singer). Marxist economics is part of a broader theoretical framework—Marxism itself—and it is this framework that I would like to briefly comment on. If I am openly defining myself as a Marxist, what do I mean by this? What do I understand it to mean to be a Marxist? Or, even better: what is Marxism? This is what I want to comment on.    

For those interested in learning more about Marxism, I have three main recommendations that will explain it much better than I could:
- [The Worldview and Philosophical Methodology of Marxism-Leninism (Translated by Luna Nguyen)](https://foreignlanguages.press/product/basic-principles-of-marxism-leninism-a-primer-jose-maria-sison/)
- [Basic Principles of Marxism-Leninism: A Primer (Jose Maria Sison)](https://foreignlanguages.press/product/basic-principles-of-marxism-leninism-a-primer-jose-maria-sison/)
- [Anti-Dühring (Friedrich Engels)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/)[^1]

> As a result, my negative criticism became positive, the polemic was transformed into a more or less connected exposition of the dialectical method and of the communist world outlook championed by Marx and myself — an exposition covering a fairly comprehensive range of subjects (Preface to Anti-Dühring).

I begin with this quotation, and I could end here. Marxism, for me, in a few words, refers to the dialectical method and the world outlook proposed by Marx and Engels. All the subsequent works aim to deepen and expand this set of ideas. Some have decided to call this set of ideas the Marxist "philosophy"; it is no coincidence that Spirkin, in *Dialectical Materialism*, says *"Philosophy is thus a unity of world-view and methodology"*. This is the way to define philosophy so that Marxist theory can be characterized as philosophy. 

Another popular way of designating Marxism is as a science, but it is necessary to clarify that this definition comes from a broader use of the term. As well explained in the book translated by Luna: 

> The word 'science,' and, by extension, “scientific” in Marxism-Leninism has specific meaning. Friedrich Engels was the first to describe the philosophy which he developed with Marx as “Scientific Socialism” in his book Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. However, it should be noted that the English phrase “scientific socialism” comes from Engels’ use of the German phrase “wissenschaftlich sozialismus.” “Wissenschaft” is a word which can be directly translated as “knowledge craft” in German, and this word encompasses a much broader and more general concept than the word “science” as it’s usually used in English... “wissenschaft” refers to a systematic pursuit of knowledge, research, theory, and understanding. “Wissenschaft” is used in any study that involves systematic investigation.

Nildo Viana, in *"Introduction to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, the Inaugural Manifesto of Historical Materialism"*, comments on Marx's use of the word philosophy to describe his set of ideas: "...*later it would also become the target of Marx's critique and would be replaced by theory, among other occasional terms, such as 'scientific socialism', 'science', and, after him, it would be called Marxism or theory).*" As we can see, many names have been used to designate what, in general, I call here simply 'Marxism'. Regardless of the name, I believe that Marxism is this communist worldview, as Engels defined it.

It is worth noting that the communist worldview involves more than just reflecting on the world and our place in it. It also requires action to transform the world. These ideas are expressed by Marx, for example, in the famous Thesis 11 on Feuerbach: *"The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it."* Or even in the manuscripts of *The German Ideology*: *"Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things."*  

At this point, I suppose it's clear that when I say I'm a Marxist, I'm not supporting a specific party or personality. I'm talking about adopting this specific worldview.[^2] So, what are the ideas that make up Marxism? I do not intend to go into details or provide a complete explanation; for that, I recommend the books listed at the beginning[^3]. Sison stated: "*In summarizing Marxism, Lenin cited philosophy, political economy, and socialism as its three basic components.*" Lenin's most well-known quote can be found in his short text *"The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism"*, where he writes: *"Marxism is the legitimate successor to the best that humanity created in the 19th century: German philosophy, English political economy, and French socialism."*

It was no accident that I opened my text with a quotation from *Anti-Dühring*; this way of dividing Marxism is the very division adopted by the book. *Anti-Dühring* is frequently recognized as one of the 'founding' books of Marxism, whether by its supporters or its critics. Ingo Elbe (an author with whom I disagree on many points) in *"Between Marx, Marxism, and Marxisms: Readings of Marx's Theory"* states: *"The birth of a 'Marxist school,' however, is unanimously dated from the publication of Anti-Dühring by Friedrich Engels in the year 1878."*

Just as Marx's main book (*Capital: A Critique of Political Economy*) is a critique of political economy, I assess that Marxism initially emerges as a general critique of the three components listed earlier: philosophy (German), political economy (English), and socialism (French). However, Marxism is not limited to critique. It also advances by formulating a response to each of these components. Once again, I would like to quote Luna:

> According to Lenin, the three component parts of Marxism (and, by extension, of Marxism-Leninism) are:
> 1. The **Philosophy of Marxism**: Including Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism
> 2. **The Political Economy of Marxism**: A system of knowledge and laws that define the production process and commodity exchange in human society.
> 3. **Scientific Socialism**: The system of thought pertaining to the establishment of the communist social economy form.

In Sison, we can read at the beginning of each chapter:
> 1. **Marxist philosophy** is also known as dialectical materialism... **Historical materialism** can be briefly defined as the application of dialectical materialism in the study of the various forms of society and their development from one form to another.
> 2. **Political Economy** is the study of the fundamental laws of motion of the entire economy of a society.
> 3. **Scientific Socialism** is the theory and practice of the modern industrial proletariat for revolutionary class struggle to emancipate itself, together with other oppressed people... to bring about and develop a society in which the means of production are under public ownership and planned production is for the good of the people rather than for the private profit of a few.

One important observation is that, in Marxist terms, revolution is a change in the social relations of production. In other words, it is a change in how different classes relate to each other and to the production and distribution of goods. That said, each of these topics will require its own in-depth exploration, but I believe what has been presented so far is sufficient to spark the reader's curiosity. To conclude, a final remark is that I believe at the root of all Marxism lies materialism (dialectical) and dialectics (materialist)[^4]. In a way, political economy, historical materialism, and scientific socialism emerge from the communist worldview, which is founded on materialism and dialectics. From this foundation, we can briefly comment on them:

> Materialism is the belief that the nature of the world is matter; that matter comes first; and that matter determines consciousness... **Dialectical Materialism** is the most advanced form of Materialism, and serves as the theoretical core of a scientific worldview.
> ... the term dialectic refers to regular relationships, interactions, transformations, motions, and developments of things, phenomena, and processes in nature, society, and human thought. **Materialist dialectics** is one of the basic theoretical parts that form the worldview and philosophical methodology of Marxism-Leninism... includes what is now called the theory of knowledge, or epistemology.

To conclude:

> ...the materialist dialectics of Marxism-Leninism unifies dialectical materialist viewpoints and materialist dialectical methodology, so it not only explains the world, but is also a tool humans can use to perceive and improve the world.

It is neither my place nor the purpose of this space to distinguish between dialectical materialism and the materialist dialectic of Marxism and earlier formulations. However, I believe this is sufficient for the reader to gain an initial understanding. In conclusion, I understand that being a Marxist means adopting the communist worldview, grounded in the principles of materialism (the idea that the material world follows objective and impersonal laws, from which consciousness arises) and dialectics (which entails the notion that everything is interconnected, in constant flux, and shaped by intrinsic contradictions within the natural world). Through the development and application of these principles across different areas, we arrive at Marxist theory in its most comprehensive form. And because I hold that this theory best describes the real world, I therefore identify myself as a Marxist.


[^1]: In Portuguese, I really like the Boitempo edition because of the notes written by José Paulo Netto.  
[^2]: And the dialectical method, which for me is an inseparable part of this worldview, not something independent. In the words of the book translated by Luna: "*...dialectics of Marxism-Leninism is a system of dialectics that is based on the foundation of the scientific materialist viewpoint.*" so for convenience I will refer only to the communist worldview.  
[^3]: An additional recommendation I make is the small book *"Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy"* by Engels.
[^4]: Using the nomenclature adopted in "*The Worldview and Philosophical Methodology of Marxism-Leninism*".
