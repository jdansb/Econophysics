## As a Worldview: An Introduction for Non-Specialists

Economy and politics are subjects that ignite fierce debate. As I am not a formal expert in the field, my first idea was to remain neutral. But true neutrality is impossible. Trying to please everyone often results in a text without personality that pleases no one.

There are at least two major approaches to studying economics, which start from completely different basic premises. One is marginalist theory (which understands the value of a good by its utility). The other is the labor theory of value from the Marxist approach. It is this second one that, in my view, is more compatible with the sciences that study real, complex systems.

But I don't want to discuss technical economics here. I'll leave that to the experts. What interests me is that Marxist economics is part of a much larger theoretical framework: **Marxism**. And it is about this framework that I want to comment.

If I define myself as a Marxist, what do I mean by that? What is Marxism?

### A Simple Definition: Worldview and Method

For me, in a few words, Marxism refers to the **dialectical method** and the **worldview** developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It is a lens for understanding the world and, simultaneously, a guide for acting to transform it.

Some call it a philosophy, others a science. The important thing is that it combines a way of thinking (method) with a way of seeing the world (vision).

> **Key Concept: Worldview**
> It is the set of fundamental beliefs and ideas we use to understand reality, answer life's big questions, and guide our actions. Marxism offers a specific worldview.

### The Three Parts of Marxism

Vladimir Lenin, a Russian revolutionary, summarized Marxism into three basic components, which were deeply developed by Marx and Engels:

1.  **Marxist Philosophy (Dialectical Materialism):**
    *   **Materialism:** The idea that the material world (nature, the economy, our bodies) exists independently of our consciousness and is the basis of everything. Simply put: objective reality comes first; our ideas are a reflection of it.
    *   **Dialectics:** The idea that everything is interconnected, in constant change, and that this change is driven by internal contradictions. Nothing is static forever.
    *   The application of this philosophy to the study of history is called **Historical Materialism**.

2.  **Marxist Political Economy:**
    *   It is the study of the laws that govern the production and distribution of goods in a society.
    *   Its main book is *Capital*, where Marx offers a profound critique of the capitalist system. The central concept here is the **Labor Theory of Value**.

> **Key Concept: Labor Theory of Value (Simplified)**
> In broad terms, Marx argues that the real value of a commodity is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor time required to produce it. Its market price fluctuates around this value.

3.  **Scientific Socialism:**
    *   This is the theory and practice of the struggle to overcome capitalism and build a new society.
    *   Unlike utopian dreams, scientific socialism is based on the analysis of the real contradictions of capitalism and identifies the working class (the **proletariat**) as the social force capable of leading this transformation.

> **Key Concept: Proletariat**
> The social class that, to survive, must sell its labor power to the owners of factories, land, and businesses (the **bourgeoisie**), as it does not own its own means of production.

### More than Interpretation, it's about Transformation

A crucial point is that Marxism is not just for contemplation. It demands action. Marx's famous phrase is: *"The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it."*

Therefore, being a Marxist, in my definition, means:
1.  Adopting this **materialist and dialectical worldview**.
2.  Understanding the economy and history through this lens.
3.  **Acting** in accordance with the struggle for the emancipation of the working class, understanding that its liberation is the key to the liberation of all humanity.

## As a Path to Overcoming Capitalism

As we have seen, Marxism is not passive. It makes us reflect on our place in the world and, consequently, on how we should act. For this reason, it has a class character: it sides with the proletariat in the struggle to overcome capitalism.

But what does "overcoming capitalism" mean?

### What is a Revolution?

The common idea is of seizing state power through an armed struggle. But for Marxism, **revolution** primarily means a change in the **relations of production** – that is, in the way classes relate to each other and how goods are produced and distributed.

What defines capitalism are relations of production based on:
*   A class that owns the means of production (bourgeoisie).
*   A class that sells its labor power to survive (proletariat).
*   The production of commodities not for direct use, but for sale on the market, aiming for profit.

### The Goal: Overcoming the Law of Value

The central goal of socialism (as a transitional stage) is to overcome the **law of value**. Since capitalist production is for exchange on the market, the value of a commodity is an abstract social relation. The goal is to organize a society that produces **directly for consumption and the well-being of the population**, not for the profit of a few.

This does not happen overnight. It requires using tools (like the state) to plan the economy and create the conditions for the market and production for exchange to become unnecessary. Some countries, like Vietnam, define their economy as a "socialist-oriented market economy," meaning they use the market while consciously working to create the conditions to overcome it in the long run.

### A Modern Example: The Law of Value and Software

The **law of value** manifests as an **average tendency**, visible only when looking at production on a large scale and over time. The equilibrium price of a commodity tends to reflect the average labor time required to produce it.

Think of a digital game. Once developed, it can be copied infinitely at almost zero cost. In a market without barriers, competition would drive the price toward zero, reflecting the very low labor time per copy. This would show the law of value in action.

But this doesn't happen. Why? Because companies use **intellectual property** (a social rule, a relation of production) to create an artificial monopoly and prevent competition, distorting the law of value and keeping prices high.

This is an example of how the development of the productive forces (the ability to copy software perfectly) comes into conflict with the current relations of production (private property and monopoly). Marxism predicts that for society to continue to develop, these relations will have to be overcome.

### Final Conclusion

Marxism offers a robust framework for understanding the world we live in – its crises, inequalities, and contradictions. It combines a practical philosophy, a critical economic analysis, and a political project for a more just society. As a worldview, it helps decipher reality; as a guide to action, it inspires its transformation.
