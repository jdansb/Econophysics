# Social Architecture of Capitalism

I donâ€™t want to write too much about this model because I want you to access my  paper: [Inequality in a model of capitalist economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22369). Besides that, it is recommended to read:  
- [The social architecture of capitalism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437104010726): The original paper where the model was proposed (also included in chapter 13 of the book *Classical Econophysics*).  
- [Agent-Based Models, Macroeconomic Scaling Laws and Sentiment Dynamics](http://macau.uni-kiel.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/dissertation_derivate_00004144/thesis_linlin.pdf): A thesis discussing the model and some modifications.  
- [Implicit Microfoundations for Macroeconomics](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1726698#): A modification proposed by Ian Wright himself.  The

But I can say that, in general, the central result of this model is that the unequal structure of wealth distribution that emerges in capitalist societies is an intrinsic feature of how capitalism organizes the production and distribution of commodities, and not a punctual failure due to any external reason outside capitalism itself. Given this fact, we have only three options: 1) accept it, 2) try to mitigate it through reforms (e.g., wealth taxes), 3) replace it with a new mode of production.
