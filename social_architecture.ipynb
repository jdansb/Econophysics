Given this fact, we have only three options: 1) accept it, 2) try to mitigate it through reforms (e.g., wealth taxes), 3) replace it with a new mode of production."

Such a model would provide a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that drive these distributions, transcending mere empirical observations to reveal the possible underlying principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "In his seminal work \"The Social Architecture of Capitalism\",  Ian Wright explores the intricate dynamics that results in the self-organization of a capitalist society with a given distribution of wealth among its members. Using an agent-based model known as Social Architecture (SA) model, Wright provides a theoretical framework aiming to explain the ubiquitous presence of Pareto's law, which reflects that a small percentage of a population controls a large portion of a particular resource such as wealth or income. Wright's work offers insights into how individual interactions and institutional structures collectively shape economic distributions.  "

        "\n",
        "The model implemented in this paper is the original SA proposed by Ian Wright. However, we have chosen a slightly different notation and terminology to align with those commonly used in econophysics and agent-based modeling.\n",
        "The society consists of $N$ agents (labeled $i=1,\\dots,N$), where each agent $i$ has a positive integer quantity $w_i(t)$ representing money which varies over time. An agent is not necessarily an individual, but can represent other economic entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The population size $N$ and the total wealth of the system $W= \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i(t)$ are conserved, so the wealth per capita $\\overline{w}=W/N$ is constant.\n",
        "Agents can be in one of three classes: employees (working class), employers (capitalist class), or unemployed.\n",
        "Then, each agent is characterized by an index $e_i\\neq i$, which identifies their employer: $e_i = j$ if agent $j$ is the employer of agent $i$, and $e_i = 0$ if agent $i$ is unemployed or employer.\n",
        "Therefore, at any time $t$,  the state of the entire economy is defined by the set of pairs $S(t) = \\left\\{ \\left( w_i(t), e_i(t) \\right) :1\\leq i\\leq N \\right\\}$. A firm  consists of a set of employees and an employer, which is the only owner of the firm.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the system size $N$ and the wealth per capita $\\overline{w}$, there are two other parameters:\n",
        "the minimum and maximum wages, $p_a$ and $p_b$, that each employee can receive. These four are the only parameters of the model.\n",
        "Random selections (of agents, wealth aliquots, wages, etc.) are made uniformly, unless otherwise specified.\n",
