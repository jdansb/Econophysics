Using an agent-based model known as Social Architecture (SA) model, Wright provides a theoretical framework aiming to explain the ubiquitous presence of Pareto's law, which reflects that a small percentage of a population controls a large portion of a particular resource such as wealth or income. Wright's work offers insights into how individual interactions and institutional structures collectively shape economic distributions.  "
