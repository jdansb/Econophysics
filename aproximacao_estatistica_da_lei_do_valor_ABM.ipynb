        "Neither the book nor the paper provide the exact implementation code of the model, so I am trying to be as faithful as possible.  However, after several weeks working on this model, some comments need to be made:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Comment 1**: At no point is it specified whether money is integer or not.  It is only mentioned that the interval from which prices are drawn is discrete,  which is a requirement for any computational model, no matter how small the intervals are.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The exchange rule can make execution excessively slow if continuous (we will use \"continuous\" to indicate that we are using variables such as float or double)  money is used,  because the model does not advance until buyers and sellers reach an agreement to clear the market.  However, if a buyer has wealth close to $m_a \\approx 0$, the commodity price defined by rule $O_1$  needs to be close to $0$ for the agent to be able to buy.  The lower the probability of this happening, the higher the wealth of the seller.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In the appendix, the book mentions implementing a limit on the number of times each agent can enter the market,  but it does not detail exactly how this is done.  I opted to use decimal money; tests with integers produced faster but less precise results.  I also limited the agents' visits to the market, regardless of success or failure, or which commodity was involved. In my tests, increasing the number of market visits up to the tested limit made the model more precise but slower.  However, I am not sure whether allowing unlimited attempts necessarily improves the results.  It would require testing to verify whether failing to obtain the desired commodity due to insufficient funds is an important part of the system's dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Comment 2**: In the implementation of rule $S_1$ for sector switching, it is not clear how the vector $\\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{(n)}$ is constructed. Is it simply the vector $\\boldsymbol{d}_{i}$ at the last step of the period, or is it some distinct vector? I opted for this simpler implementation mentioned.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, in this same rule, it is stated that if there was an error increment, the agent should move to a *new sector*, but it says that the new sector is drawn uniformly among the $L$ sectors. It is ambiguous whether the agent can end up remaining in the same sector. I implemented it so that the agent is forced to switch sectors. Some tests also suggest that this dynamic of agents switching between sectors plays an important role in distributing money among agents and sectors within the system, even when the system is in statistical equilibrium.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Comment 3**: It was not clear to me what happens if, when applying rule $E_1$, the seller's offer $p_j^{(s)}$ is greater than the buyer's offer $p_j^{(b)}$. I assume that we always take both the buyer's and seller's offers and draw the final price between the smaller and the larger of the two, regardless of who is making the offer.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In the application of rule $O_1$, it is allowed for a commodity to have a price $p=0$. Depending on the total amount of money, it is highly possible that a commodity could be exchanged at no price if we work with integers, which seems undesirable to me.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Comment 4**: To conclude, I must admit that I had difficulty obtaining the results presented for $L>2$. I initially tried to implement the code in Python, but then migrated to C# in search of higher execution speed. My results show a clear tendency for prices to be proportional to value, but not always with as strong a correlation as presented in both the book and the paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "I believe that, besides some possible implementation differences, there are certain distributions of production rates and deficits for which the model can exhibit a higher correlation rate, and some parameter choices can make the model more accurate while at the same time increasing computational cost. In my tests, as mentioned, increasing the number of market visits per agent had a positive effect on the final result. Increasing the number of agents itself also helped, as well as using continuous money instead of integer. All these decisions improve the result at the expense of higher computational cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "Increasing the data capture window—for example, averaging over 50,000 steps instead of 5,000—also had a positive effect, again at the cost of increasing the time required for the simulation to run. This is why I ultimately implemented the code in C#, as can be seen [here](https://github.com/jdansb/Econophysics/blob/main/price_and_value.cs).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "However, I must warn that I still believe there may be some subtle differences compared to the original proposal due to the difficulty of faithfully reproducing the results. The correlation originally reported, even for $L=5$, was around 9.8 over 10 runs, and in one case even reached 1. Nonetheless, I believe that this version of the model is already sufficient to investigate the issue. Suggestions for improvement are welcome.  \n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main problems I notice is that the commodity with the longest production time seems to struggle to achieve the highest price. If we have $L=5$, the other four commodities follow a very strong linear trend, while this last commodity has difficulty showing the expected results. Additionally, this commodity also exhibits an extremely low number of transactions, which I believe is a result of the deficit accumulated in previous steps and the fact that the model prioritizes consumption over exchange. Thus, I assume (though further investigation is needed) that agents who start working in this sector largely end up producing more for consumption than for exchange, even more so than in the other sectors.\n"

We can note that the distribution of workers in each sector follows the efficient distribution, and that the price increases with value, except for the highest-value commodity. However, it has an exchange volume 13 times lower than the second-lowest traded commodity. One commodity was exchanged roughly every 500 steps.  If we take into account the number of transactions per agent, the figure becomes even lower. The number of exchanges per agent, for each commodity, is: $[98.75, 5137.26, 568.45, 44.14, 2.46]$.\n",

Despite everything, the relationship between value and price remains clear: If you increase the average production time of a commodity, the average price at which this commodity will be traded tends to increase. The correlation considering all commodities is 0.84, and disregarding the highest-value commodity it is 0.97. The production time for each commodity is $[1,1.5,2,2.5,3]$, and the time required to increase a unit of deficit for all commodities is $10$.\n"

Alternatively, we can think of it as a kind of added value $n_{j} = \\frac{b}{\\lambda}$ in the commodity, which is not directly defined but emerges from the dynamics of the model.
